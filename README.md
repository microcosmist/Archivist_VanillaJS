<h1 align="center">Archivist</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Archivist is a bookshelf web app that I designed to replicate the experience of a traditional bookshelf in a digital age. I was inspired by a desire to showcase and visually interact with my reading list in the same way I would with physical books. 
    The goal of this project was to allow users to add, update, and delete books from their reading list. Additionally I wanted users to be able to share and compile reviews. While the current version is a prototype, the final product will be built with React for a more dynamic and smooth experience.
